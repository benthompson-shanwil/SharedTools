# humuhumunukunukuapua'a
I live around Hawaii and am also known as reef triggerfish

This fish's name translates to something like 'fish with a snout like a pig.' In the Hawaiian
language, a sound is repeated (for example, nukunuku in this fish's name) to emphasize or strengthen
the importance. 'nuku' translates as beak or nose, so 'nukunuku' tells us that the nose of this fish
is an important or defining characteristic of the fish.
